# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

### Purpose

The purpose is to help Louise compare similar theater/play campaigns to help her determine the best time to launch her campaign. 

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

We looked at and compared the number of successful, failed, and canceled kickstarter campaigns based on the month they started. 

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

We looked at and compared the number of successful, failed, and canceled kickstarter campaigns based on different ranges of funding goals. 

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

Initially ran into challenges with the formulas for the "Outcomes Based on Goals" section with improper set ranges. 

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

1. The best time to launch a campaign is in the month of May. 
2. The worst time to launch a campaign is in the month of December where nearly 50% of the 75 campaigns were either successful or failed.

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

Campaigns with goals less than $5,000 have the highest rate of success at over 73% (76% less than $1,000). 
Goals between $5,000 - $25,000 have around a 50% success rate.
Campaigns over $25,000 have at 27% or less success rate.

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

These campaigns are not specified by their country for Outcomes based on Goals and Launch Date. 
Not enough samples of campaigns with goals above $25,000.

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?

We could utilize bar charts for a different visulation of the results.
